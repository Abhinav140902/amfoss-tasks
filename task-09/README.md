# Task:
The task is to spam with messeages on telegram web using JavaScript.

## Procedure
- I have learnt some basics of JavaScript and Html before starting the task.
- JavaScript is some kind of similar to python and C. So it didn't took much time for me to understand.
- I have included a timer under which on each interval button gets triggered. Interval is the time gap between each message.
- I have included a time gap of 1000 milliseconds for each message.
- Firstly we should select the message we want to spam. Then, that message will be copied into the text box and triggers a mousedown event in the submit button. And it keeps on iterating after every 1000 milliseconds.

## Instructions
- The first step is, we should go to the [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/).
- And then we should open the console tab from the developer tools.
- Then we should paste the code in the console tab and should press enter.
That's it, the spamming of messages gets started.
