# Debugging Derbies
**Task**
The task is to fix all the bugs that are encountered in the given java code.

**Installation**
- Firstly, Java Runtime Environment (JRE) should be installed. The command to install JRE is `sudo apt install default-jre`.
- JRE is used to run Java softwares.
- Afterthat I have installed Java Development kit (JDK), It is also used to run Java softwares. The command to install JDK is `sudo apt install default-jdk`.

**To get the java code, we should run the following code in the terminal** 

`$ wget -O MathQuiz.java http://tiny.cc/amfoss-task4`


## Procedure
- When I first ran the code there were some syntax errors like missing semicolons etc in the code.
- After fixing the syntax errors and ran the program, there were some functional errors like when I click start button and stop button it triggers and vice versa.
- After all the errors are fixed, I found that some Arithematical errors were written wrong in the code. After fixing them, Addition, Subtraction, Mulitiplication and Division worked perfectly.
- After that I found that the time displaying is wrong. Then I converted milliseconds into seconds by using some basic math. 
- I have fixed most of the errors by reading the comments and I used the search option to find the position of the required fuction in the code.
- Finally, the Mathquiz worked perfectly.
