# Introseption 

## Why must we choose you?
I was always passionate to learn coding and new technologies and I think amFOSS will guide me to the path where I can develop my skills. Even I had no programming backround, I tried my level best to do the tasks and completed as many as possible. I had learnt many things while doing these tasks and I am sure that I will learn many more things in the club. I have faced many hurdles while doing the tasks and finally done as many as possible tasks. I deseperately need mentorship and I am pretty sure that amFOSS is the perfect place where I could get it. If I get into the club, I am sure I will help the juniors as I have faced those problems.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Maintaining a good CGPA
