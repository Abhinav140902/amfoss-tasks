# Introseption 

## Why must we choose you?
I was always passionate to learn coding and new technologies and I think amFOSS will guide me to the path where I can develop my skills. Even I had no programming backround, I tried my level best to do the tasks and completed as many as possible. I had learnt many things while doing these tasks and I am sure that I will learn many more things in the club. I have faced many hurdles while doing the tasks and finally done as many as possible tasks. I deseperately need mentorship and I am pretty sure that amFOSS is the perfect place where I could get it. If I get into the club, I am sure I will help the juniors as I have faced those problems.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Maintaining a good CGPA and improving my skills and spending as much as time possible in the club and giving my best to the club. Fousing and learning new technologies as well.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will try my best to put myself involved into the club. I would be more than happy to transfer my knowledge to my juniors, who are really intrested in this field. I will actively participate in all the activities that are conducted by the club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I really like this process of selection. At the initial stage, I found the tasks were a bit difficult as I am from non-cs background but later I learnt many things in this process. This type of selection process helps to find the deserving candidates who are ready to learn and put their maximum effort.
