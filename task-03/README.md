My HackerRank Username: **U4ELC20033**

I have used Python for solving these HackerRank problems. I have no programming background, so as I learnt Python in my semester 1, I have used python for solving those problems. I have felt this task a bit difficult as I had a little knowledge in competative programming. I am sure I will work hard on competative problems and will develop my problem solving skills.
